    <h1>Luca Vaudano's Blog</h1>
    <p>
        <p>Hi! I&#39;m Luca and this is my blog. I will post about my take on, including but not limited to, Cybersecurity, Machine Learning, AI/ML Security and more. Come take a look!</p>
        <h1 id="why-have-a-blog-">Why have a blog?</h1>
        <p>Writing is one of those skills you can get better at just by doing it. It’s not just about putting words on a page; it’s about clarifying your own thoughts. When I write, it forces me to figure out what I really think. Sometimes, writing is the only way I can make sense of what&#39;s in my head.</p>
        <p>This blog is a place for me to do just that — make sense of things. Here, you’ll find my thoughts on cybersecurity, machine learning, and maybe a mix of other topics that catch my interest. I’m still figuring it out, and that’s part of the fun.</p>
        <p>So, if you’re curious too, come along for the ride. Let’s see where this takes us.</p>
